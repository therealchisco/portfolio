The "RMS" (Restaurant Menu System) app was developed to address the needs of restaurants that operate without traditional serving staff. This innovative solution enables customers to place orders directly from their tables and receive notifications when their orders are ready. By leveraging real-time communication technology, the app seamlessly connects customers, kitchen staff, and the back office, resulting in streamlined operations and reduced costs.
